## Introduction

In the age of digital imaging, the need for efficient image processing solutions is more significant than ever. **ImageFilterCPP** serves as a practical example of how to implement custom image filters using the MRTech IFF C++ SDK. This project leverages the power of CUDA to accelerate image processing tasks, ensuring smooth performance even in demanding scenarios.

## Features

- **Custom Filters**: Create and apply various filters to images.
- **CUDA Acceleration**: Utilize GPU resources for faster processing.
- **Low Latency**: Ideal for real-time applications.
- **Demosaicing**: Convert raw image data from sensors into viewable images.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Handle DNG, TIFF, and other image formats.
- **Integration with GenICam**: Streamline camera communication.
- **REST API Support**: Access filters and images over the network.
- **RTSP Streaming**: Stream processed images in real-time.
- **Vulkan Support**: Leverage modern graphics APIs for rendering.

## Installation

To get started with **ImageFilterCPP**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Matiasddg/imagefiltercpp.git
   cd imagefiltercpp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following installed:
   - C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
   - CUDA Toolkit
   - MRTech IFF C++ SDK

3. **Build the Project**:
   Use CMake to configure and build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Example**:
   Execute the example application to see the filter in action:
   ```bash
   ./ImageFilterExample
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the image filter in your applications. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to apply a filter:

```cpp
#include "ImageFilter.h"

int main() {
    ImageFilter filter;
    filter.loadImage("input.dng");
    filter.applyFilter();
    filter.saveImage("output.tiff");
    return 0;
}
```

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.
